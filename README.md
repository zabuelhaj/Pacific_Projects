# Pacific_Projects
A culmination of my work (Independent and with teams) at University of the Pacific; from Undergraduate to Graduate.

### [Microcontrollers](https://github.com/zabuelhaj/Pacific_Projects/tree/master/MP3_Full_Code) ###  
This is an MP3 player that I worked on throughout my Fall 2017 semester. It was developed in C with one portion developed in ARM/Thumb-2 Assembly; the entire project was developed with direct-register manipulation.

### [Embedded Systems](https://github.com/zabuelhaj/Pacific_Projects/tree/master/Embedded_Systems) ###  
These are a handful of projects I completed in my Embedded Systems course during Spring 2018. All of the projects were completed in C, with a couple being conceptual (thus they were not developed on a microcontroller).  

[Real-Time Shortest Job First](https://github.com/zabuelhaj/Pacific_Projects/tree/master/Embedded_Systems/Final_Project)  
This was my team's final project for the course. It is a real-time scheduler that takes push-button inputs from a user to add processes to a queue. When a process is added, the queue adjusts to prioritize processes. The final project was completed using the TivaWare API library.  
[Traffic Scheduler](https://github.com/zabuelhaj/Pacific_Projects/tree/master/Embedded_Systems/Traffic_Scheduling)  
This project was to implement scheduling for traffic lights at an intersection. It uses push-button input to add an ambulance, in which case the lights will change to control traffic and give the ambulance's lane a green light. It was completed using direct-register manipulation.  
[Scheduling Concepts](https://github.com/zabuelhaj/Pacific_Projects/tree/master/Embedded_Systems/Concepts_Scheduling)  
These two projects were completed to test concepts learned in class. One is the classic Hungry Philosophers problem; the other is a simple Queue implementation.

### [Autonomous Robotics](https://github.com/zabuelhaj/Pacific_Projects/tree/master/Autonomous_Robotics) ###  
Because I completed both the Bachelor's and Master's programs at Pacific, I had the opportunity to enroll in both graduate and undergraduate robotics courses. These both focused on autonomous robotic systems, with the "brains" being a Raspberry Pi and TM4C Microcontroller.  

[Basic Implementations](https://github.com/zabuelhaj/Pacific_Projects/tree/master/Autonomous_Robotics/Undergraduate_Projects)  
The source code found here is from the undergraduate course. I worked with a teammate throughout the semester, using Python on the Raspberry Pi and C on the microcontroller. The microcontroller code was developed with the TivaWare API.  

There are four directories here: [Base_Code](https://github.com/zabuelhaj/Pacific_Projects/tree/master/Autonomous_Robotics/Undergraduate_Projects/Base_Code) is, well... The base code that was developed throughout the semester. The other three directories are additional files or modifications made to the base code to complete different tasks. An example being [Potential_Fields](https://github.com/zabuelhaj/Pacific_Projects/tree/master/Autonomous_Robotics/Undergraduate_Projects/Potential_Fields), which contains a Matlab simulation I made as well as the Python code developed to implement this algorithm on the robot. [Grid_Map](https://github.com/zabuelhaj/Pacific_Projects/tree/master/Autonomous_Robotics/Undergraduate_Projects/Grid_Map) is a basic implementation of a single-heuristic grid map. [Final_Competition](https://github.com/zabuelhaj/Pacific_Projects/tree/master/Autonomous_Robotics/Undergraduate_Projects/Final_Competition) is the modified code used to traverse the robot through a maze; this was quite literally a competetion at the end of the semester. No, my teammate and I did not win; there were too many "special features" on our robot.
