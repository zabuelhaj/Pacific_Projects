# Pacific_Projects
A culmination of my work (Independent and with teams) at University of the Pacific; from Undergraduate to Graduate.

[Microcontrollers: MP3 Player](https://github.com/zabuelhaj/Pacific_Projects/tree/master/MP3_Full_Code)  
This is an MP3 player that I worked on throughout my Fall 2017 semester. It was developed in C with one portion developed in ARM/Thumb-2 Assembly.
